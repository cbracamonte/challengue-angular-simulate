  UI/UX design patterns and design system architecture.
  TRIGGER when: working on component design, layout/grid decisions, design tokens,
  color palettes, typography, accessibility (WCAG), responsive design, TUI aesthetics,
  or creating DESIGN.md documentation. Covers React, Tailwind CSS, terminal UI, and
  mobile patterns with a monospace-first, constraint-based design philosophy.
  DO NOT TRIGGER when: writing React/TypeScript code logic (use droo-stack skill),
  building Raxol TUI framework features (use raxol skill), working with
  CSS-in-JS runtime concerns (this skill covers design decisions, not runtime),
  or designing API/module/public-surface interfaces (use interface-designer skill).

# design-ux

Constraint-based design. Monospace-first. Every pixel earns its place. Zero layout shift. The terminal is the design system's origin; web and mobile are projections from it.

Design decisions flow from constraints, not decoration. Start from the character grid, add only what communicates. If a visual element does not serve information hierarchy, remove it.

## What You Get

- Design token systems and theming architecture
- Component composition patterns (React, TUI, mobile)
- Typography, color, and spacing decisions with constraint rationale
- Accessibility audit checklist (WCAG AA)
- Terminal-first design principles for monospace layouts

## When to Use

- Component architecture and composition patterns
- Design token systems and theming
- Typography, color, and spacing decisions
- Accessibility and WCAG compliance
- Layout and grid systems
- Terminal UI design principles
- Mobile/responsive design
- Design documentation (DESIGN.md)

## When NOT to Use

- **Code-level patterns** (TypeScript, React hooks, error handling) -- use `droo-stack`
- **Raxol framework API** (TEA agents, headless sessions, MCP tools) -- use `raxol`
- **Claude/Anthropic SDK integration** -- use `claude-api`
- **Solidity/smart contract design** -- use `solidity-auditor`

## Common Pitfalls

| Mistake                            | Why It Fails                                  | Better Approach                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Fixed-width containers             | Breaks responsive design and terminal scaling | Use `min/max/fit-content` constraints                 |
| Raw hex colors in components       | Breaks theming, dark mode fails silently      | Use semantic tokens (`text-foreground`, `bg-surface`) |
| Decorative visual elements         | Noise, obscures info hierarchy                | Remove if it doesn't communicate or differentiate     |
| Color-only differentiation         | Excludes colorblind users (WCAG fail)         | Combine color with icon, shape, or text label         |
| Keyboard-inaccessible components   | Excludes keyboard-only users (WCAG AA fail)   | Test all interactive components with Tab key          |
| Giant component with boolean props | Unmaintainable, untestable API surface        | Compose small focused components                      |
| Pixel-perfect layouts              | Fragile across viewports and font sizes       | Constraint-based sizing from content                  |

## Key Conventions

- **Terminal is origin**: Design for the character grid first, then project to pixel-based media
- **Semantic over literal**: Use token names (`text-foreground`, `bg-surface`), never raw values in components
- **Composition over configuration**: Small, composable components beat mega-components with boolean props
- **Constraint-based sizing**: Prefer `min/max/fit-content` over fixed pixel widths
- **Monospace default**: Sans-serif is the exception, not the rule
